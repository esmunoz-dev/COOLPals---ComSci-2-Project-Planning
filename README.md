Password Strength Checker
Presented By: COOLPals
(Morales, Muñoz, Villacillo)













Problem Statement: 
Many people struggle with the problem of finding a strong and reliable password for websites, professional use, and personal use. This seemingly small problem affects around 25% - 67% of individuals.

Project Objectives:
	Our group's objective is to give stronger passwords to the people with this problem. To help them lessen their stress in finding the right password with the right amount of numbers, symbols, and letters.

Planned Features:
To make our project function completely and work as planned, we want it to contain features that, first of all, tests the password to tell the user if password input is already enough, and if not recommend a better password of mixed letters and symbols.

Planned Inputs and Outputs:
The inputs that we have in mind is that the users will give mainly their password. And the output/s that this program will give to the user is if their password is strong, which is said as the amount of special characters, letters, and numbers, and how to make their password stronger if it doesn't meet the criteria.  





Logic Plan:
Print a simple Menu with choices (1 & 2):

Pick a choice (1 or 2):

If Choice 1 (Give a password to store in a file): ask for name, birthday, school in elementary,

Input any password on a text box:

If Choice 2 (recommend a good password)

If: the password has more than 10 total figures, more than 5 letters, 
more than 3 numbers, and more than 2 symbols.
		Print “The given password looks good”
			Then save password in a reusable file:
Elif: recommend a random symbols generator that makes a good password.
	Print a random good password:
	If yes then continue, else use the original password.
